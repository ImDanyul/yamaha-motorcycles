## Features

Positioned at the top is the website's title, which serves as a convenient way to navigate back to the home page.

Located on the upper right of the screen is a navigation menu, with easy access to specific areas of interest with a single click. This quick navigation section includes Home, R1, R6, and R3.

The navigation bar highlights the current page, utilizing an underlining marker to provide a clear visual cue as users hover over different options.

The design is meant to be minimalism to maintain a clean and uncluttered header, ensuring a seamless and focused user experience.

The home page features a distinctive highlight border, enhancing user interaction and providing a visual indicator, especially on larger screens.

## Landing page

The landing page showcases 3 eye-catching images, each containing a text box at the bottom to identify and distinguish each bike. These images are designed to highlight when hovered over, offering a dynamic and interactive experience for users.
