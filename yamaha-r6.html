          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Introduced in 1999 as the super-sport counterpart to the YZF-R1
            superbike, the YZF-R6 was designed to complement the street-focused
            YZF600R sport bike, which continued to be available alongside the
            R6. Featuring a groundbreaking engine design from Yamaha, the R6
            could produce over 108 hp (81 kW) even while stationary, marking it
            as the world's first 600 cc production four-stroke motorcycle
            capable of generating over 100 hp (75 kW) in stock form. Since its
            debut, the YZF-R6 has undergone multiple revisions. Notably, the
            2003 model marked the transition to fuel injection. In 2006,
            significant upgrades were introduced, including a new
            engine-management system with the YCC-T ride-by-wire throttle and
            the incorporation of a multiplate slipper clutch. The 2008 model
            further enhanced performance with the addition of the YCC-I
            variable-length intake system, optimizing power at high engine
            speeds, and an improved Deltabox frame design.
